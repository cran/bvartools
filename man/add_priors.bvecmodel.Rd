\arguments{
\item{object}{a list, usually, the output of a call to \code{\link{gen_vec}}.}

\item{coef}{a named list of prior specifications for coefficients that do not 
determine the cointegration space. For the default specification all prior means are set to zero
and the diagonal elements of the inverse prior variance-covariance matrix are set to 1
for coefficients corresponding to non-deterministic terms. For deterministic coefficients the prior
variances are set to 10 by \code{v_i_det = 0.1}. The variances need to be specified as precisions,
i.e. as inverses of the variances. For further specifications such as the Minnesota prior see 'Details'.}

\item{coint}{a named list of prior specifications for coefficients determining the
cointegration space of VEC models. See 'Details'.}

\item{sigma}{a named list of prior specifications for the error variance-covariance matrix
of the models. For the default specification of an inverse Wishart distribution
the prior degrees of freedom are set to the number of endogenous variables plus the rank of
the cointegration matrix. The prior variance is to 1. See 'Details'.}

\item{ssvs}{optional; a named list of prior specifications for the SSVS algorithm.
Not allowed for TVP models. See 'Details'.}

\description{
Adds prior specifications to a list of models, which was produced by
function \code{\link{gen_vec}}.
}
\details{
The arguments of the function require named lists. Possible
specifications are described in the following. Note that it is important to specify the
priors in the correct list. Otherwise, the provided specification will be disregarded
and default values will be used.

Argument \code{coef} contains the following elements
\describe{
  \item{\code{v_i}}{a numeric specifying the prior precision of the coefficients. Default is 1.}
  \item{\code{v_i_det}}{a numeric specifying the prior precision of coefficients that correspond
  to deterministic terms. Default is 0.1.}
  \item{\code{const}}{a character specifying the prior mean of coefficients, which correspond
  to the intercept. If \code{const = "mean"}, the means of the series of endogenous variables
  are used as prior means. If \code{const = "first"}, the first values of the series of endogenous
  variables are used as prior means.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a list of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota prior, where the element names must be \code{kappa0}, \code{kappa1}, \code{kappa2} and \code{kappa3}.
  For the endogenous variable \eqn{i} the prior variance of the \eqn{l}th lag of regressor \eqn{j} is obtained as
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0}}{l^2} \textrm{ for own lags of endogenous variables,}} 
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0} \kappa_{1}}{l^2} \frac{\sigma_{i}^2}{\sigma_{j}^2} \textrm{ for endogenous variables other than own lags,}}
  \deqn{ \frac{\kappa_{0} \kappa_{2}}{(l+1)^2} \frac{\sigma_{i}^2}{\sigma_{j}^2} \textrm{ for exogenous variables,}}
  \deqn{ \kappa_{0} \kappa_{3} \sigma_{i}^2 \textrm{ for deterministic terms,}}
  where \eqn{\sigma_{i}} is the residual standard deviation of variable \eqn{i} of an unrestricted
  LS estimate. For exogenous variables \eqn{\sigma_{i}} is the sample standard deviation.
  
  The function only provides priors for the non-cointegration part of the model. However,
  the residual standard errors \eqn{\sigma_i} are based on an unrestricted LS regression of the
  endogenous variables on the error correction term and the non-cointegration regressors.}
  \item{\code{max_var}}{a numeric specifying the maximum prior variance that is allowed for
  non-deterministic coefficients.}
  \item{\code{shape}}{a numeric specifying the prior shape parameter of the error term of the
  state equation. Only used for models with time varying parameters. Default is 3.}
  \item{\code{rate}}{a numeric specifying the prior rate parameter of the error term of the
  state equation. Only used for models with time varying parameters. Default is 0.0001.}
  \item{\code{rate_det}}{a numeric specifying the prior rate parameter of the error term of the
  state equation for coefficients, which correspond to deterministic terms.
  Only used for models with time varying parameters. Default is 0.01.}
}
If \code{minnesota} is specified, elements \code{v_i} and \code{v_i_det} are ignored.

Argument \code{coint} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{v_i}}{numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the shrinkage of the cointegration space prior. Default is 0.}
  \item{\code{p_tau_i}}{numeric of the diagonal elements of the inverse prior matrix of
  the central location of the cointegration space \eqn{sp(\beta)}. Default is 1.}
  \item{\code{shape}}{an integer specifying the prior degrees of freedom of the error term of the state equation
  of the loading matrix \eqn{\alpha}. Default is 3.}
  \item{\code{rate}}{a numeric specifying the prior variance of error term of the state equation
  of the loading matrix \eqn{\alpha}. Default is 0.0001.}
  \item{\code{rho}}{a numeric specifying the autocorrelation coefficient
  of the state equation of \eqn{\beta}. It must be smaller than 1. Default is 0.999.
  Note that in contrast to Koop et al. (2011) \eqn{\rho} is not drawn in the Gibbs sampler of
  this package yet.}
}

Argument \code{sigma} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{df}}{an integer or character specifying the prior degrees of freedom of the error term. Only
  used, if the prior is inverse Wishart.
  Default is \code{"k"}, which indicates the amount of endogenous variables in the respective model.
  \code{"k + 3"} can be used to set the prior to the amount of endogenous variables plus 3. If an integer
  is provided, the degrees of freedom are set to this value in all models.
  In all cases the rank \eqn{r} of the cointegration matrix is automatically added.}
  \item{\code{scale}}{a numeric specifying the prior error variance of endogenous variables.
  Default is 1.}
  \item{\code{shape}}{a numeric or character specifying the prior shape parameter of the error term. Only
  used, if the prior is inverse gamma or if time varying volatilities are estimated.
  For models with constant volatility the default is \code{"k"}, which indicates the amount of endogenous
  variables in the respective country model. \code{"k + 3"} can be used to set the prior to the amount of
  endogenous variables plus 3. If a numeric is provided, the shape parameters are set to this value in all
  models. For models with stochastic volatility this prior refers to the error variance of the state
  equation.}
  \item{\code{rate}}{a numeric specifying the prior rate parameter of the error term. Only used, if the
  prior is inverse gamma or if time varying volatilities are estimated. For models with stochastic
  volatility this prior refers to the error variance of the state equation.}
  \item{\code{mu}}{numeric of the prior mean of the initial state of the log-volatilities.
  Only used for models with time varying volatility.}
  \item{\code{v_i}}{numeric of the prior precision of the initial state of the log-volatilities.
  Only used for models with time varying volatility.}
  \item{\code{sigma_h}}{numeric of the initial draw for the variance of the log-volatilities.
  Only used for models with time varying volatility.}
  \item{\code{constant}}{numeric of the constant, which is added before taking the log of the squared errors.
  Only used for models with time varying volatility.}
  \item{\code{covar}}{logical indicating whether error covariances should be estimated. Only used
  in combination with an inverse gamma prior or stochastic volatility, for which \code{shape} and
  \code{rate} must be specified.}
}
\code{df} and \code{scale} must be specified for an inverse Wishart prior. \code{shape} and \code{rate}
are required for an inverse gamma prior. For structural models or models with stochastic volatility
only a gamma prior specification is allowed.

Argument \code{ssvs} can contain the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{inprior}}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the prior probability
  of a variable to be included in the model.}
  \item{\code{tau}}{a numeric vector of two elements containing the prior standard errors
  of restricted variables (\eqn{\tau_0}) as its first element and unrestricted variables (\eqn{\tau_1})
  as its second.}
  \item{\code{semiautomatic}}{an numeric vector of two elements containing the
  factors by which the standard errors associated with an unconstrained least squares
  estimate of the model are multiplied to obtain the prior standard errors
  of restricted (\eqn{\tau_0}) and unrestricted (\eqn{\tau_1}) variables, respectively.
  This is the semiautomatic approach described in George et al. (2008).}
  \item{\code{covar}}{logical indicating if SSVS should also be applied to the error covariance matrix
  as in George et al. (2008).}
  \item{\code{exclude_det}}{logical indicating if deterministic terms should be excluded from the SSVS algorithm.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a numeric vector of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota-like inclusion priors. See below.}
}
Either \code{tau} or \code{semiautomatic} must be specified.

The argument \code{bvs} can contain the following elements
\describe{
  \item{\code{inprior}}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the prior probability
  of a variable to be included in the model.}
  \item{\code{covar}}{logical indicating if BVS should also be applied to the error covariance matrix.}
  \item{\code{exclude_det}}{logical indicating if deterministic terms should be excluded from the BVS algorithm.}
  \item{\code{minnesota}}{a numeric vector of length 4 containing parameters for the calculation of
  the Minnesota-like inclusion priors. See below.}
}

If either \code{ssvs$minnesota} or \code{bvs$minnesota} is specified, prior inclusion probabilities
are calculated in a Minnesota-like fashion as
\tabular{cl}{
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_1}{l}} \tab for own lags of endogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_2}{l}} \tab for other endogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\frac{\kappa_3}{1 + l}} \tab for exogenous variables, \cr
\eqn{\kappa_{4}} \tab for deterministic variables, 
}
for lag \eqn{l} with \eqn{\kappa_1}, \eqn{\kappa_2}, \eqn{\kappa_3}, \eqn{\kappa_4} as the first, second,
third and forth element in \code{ssvs$minnesota} or \code{bvs$minnesota}, respectively.
